## Misc Tweaks

- **NEW SETTING**: Do not Limit random Pokemon Pool
  - This setting is found on Foe Pokemon and exempts randomization from limits meaning neither generational limits nor banlist limits affect randomization.

- **FIX**: Allowed Evolutions in the Limit Section now get properly banned by the Banned Pokemon List
