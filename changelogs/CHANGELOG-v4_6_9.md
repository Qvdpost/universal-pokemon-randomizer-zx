## General

- **NEW:** **Banned Moves Editor & Moveset Integration**
    - The Banned Moves editor has been implemented. It uses a two-column table where you can specify what each banned move should be replaced with during randomization.
    - Added a new **"No Banned Moves"** setting to the Moves & Movesets tab. When enabled, moves in your banned list will be excluded from the random move pool.
    - Added an **"Only Randomize Banned Moves"** sub-setting. This allows you to keep all existing moves on a Pokémon's moveset *except* those you have specifically banned, which will then be randomized or replaced with your chosen move.
    - The Banned Moves Editor can be accessed from the Settings menu, under the "Banned Moves Editor" option.
